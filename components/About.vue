        About Me
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer, I am doing my
        software Engineering degree from University of Engineering and
        Technology Mardan. In the end of 2021, I started my journey as Web
        developer: First I learned
        <strong text-orange-600>HTML and CSS</strong>, then
        <strong text-yellow>JavaScript</strong>, after that I learned
        <strong text-blue-700>PHP</strong> and currently I am learning
        JavaScript Frameworks like <strong text-sky>ReactJs</strong>,
        <strong text-green-600>VueJs</strong> and
        <strong text-green>NuxtJs</strong>. In addition to these I have
        understanding of Design principles, and can design websites in Figma. I
        have a full grip on <strong text-orange-600>custom CSS</strong> but I
        also use <strong text-sky>Tailwind</strong>,
        <strong text-sky-300>Windi</strong> and
        <strong text-gray-5 dark:text-gray-2>UnoCSS</strong>. In the upcomming
        months I'm looking forward to master ReactJS and NextJs. From there I
        will go for <strong text-blue-400>React Native</strong> as well.
